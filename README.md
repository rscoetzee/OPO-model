# OPO-model
The scripts solve the nonlinear coupled wave equations for light propagating through some nonlinear medium. 
The equations themselves are solved via the Cash-Karp RK4 algorithm. This model assumes monochromatic light and electric fields with a plane wave structure.
The input fields have a gaussian time profile and are oscillated in a cavity by applying appropriate boundry conditions.
The model was written in MATLAB.
